This assignment consists of developing an application for mobile devices. The application includes the following *use cases*:

- Browse cooking recipes

  > The user specifies the recipes to browse by entering the following data: keywords and categorization.  
  > The application performs a search on the [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) server and displays a list of recipes that match the criteria.

  > :note: The different categorization options are those provided by the server's *API*. Some examples: type of food, calorie range, cuisine type, etc.

- View a recipe in detail

  > The user selects a specific recipe, and the application displays its details.

> :warning: To use the service, you must register on their website and obtain the corresponding *tokens*.
